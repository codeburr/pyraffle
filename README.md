# pyraffle
A simple raffle console app python-based.

In order to use it, you have to:

1- Have python, of course.

2- Create a "names.txt" file in the same folder, using lines to separate names.

3- Execute "python <raffle.py filepath>" in the console.

The result will be shown in the console and in the "log.txt" file as well.
